# CSS battles Solution

[CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/) is ridiculously fun and has taught me a lot about CSS. This repo includes my CSS Battle solutions and hopefully it's useful to someone. 
The repo has a folder for each battle and within contains each of the challenges (there will be some missing but I will update once I have completed them). 

## Challenge Stucture

Each `md` file will include the following

- Challenge Number and Name
- Image of the Challenge
- Pretty Solution (This might not be there each time)
- Optimised Solution
